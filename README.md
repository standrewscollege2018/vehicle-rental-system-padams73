# vehicle-mgmt-system
Vehicle management system to practice using classes in Python

Design a basic vehicle rental system where the user can select vehicles to be rented

Each vehicle should have a name, number of seats, and availability as properties.

The user should be able to search by number of seats required, returning a list of all available vehicles.
When a vehicle is rented, its availability changes to False.

Vehicles can be returned, which changes availability to True.
