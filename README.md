Vehicle management system to practice using classes in Python

Design a basic vehicle rental system where the user can select vehicles to be rented

Each vehicle should have a name, licence number, number of seats, and availability as properties. If a vehicle is unavailable then the name of the renter should be set.

The user should be able to search by number of seats required, returning a list of all available vehicles.
When a vehicle is rented, its availability changes to False.

Vehicles can be returned, which changes availability to True.

Sample vehicles:
Suzuki Van - 2 seats
Toyota Corolla - 4 seats
Honda CRV - 4 seats
Subaru Outback - 5 seats
Toyota Previa - 7 seats
Toyota Hiace - 12 seats
